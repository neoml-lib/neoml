// This layer performs a special convolution used in BERT architecture
//
// This operation extracts the convolution regions as if 1-dimensional kernel of size (kernel size)
// would move along (sequence length) padded by ((kernel size) - 1 / 2) zeros from both sides.
// Then it applies different kernel values for every position along (sequence length), (batch size) and (num heads).
// The only dimension shared betweed different kernels is (head size).
// The kernel values are provided by an additional input.
//
// First input: convolution data
//     - BD_BatchLentgh is equal to (sequence length)
//     - BD_BatchWidth is equal to (batch size)
//     - BD_Channels is equal to (attention heads) * (head size)
//     - others are equal to 1
//
// Second input: convolution kernels
//     - BD_BatchLength is equal to (sequence length)
//     - BD_BatchWidth is equal to (batch size) * (attention heads)
//     - BD_Height is equal to (kernel size)
//     - others are equal to 1
//
// Output:
//     - BD_BatchLength is equal to (sequence length)
//     - BD_BatchWidth is equal to (batch size) * (attention heads)
//     - BD_Height is equal to (head size)
//     - others are equal to 1
