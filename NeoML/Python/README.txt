# NeoML

NeoML is an end-to-end machine learning framework that allows you to build, train, and deploy ML models. It provides many traditional ML algorithms and neural networks with support for over 100 layer types.

NeoML is designed to minimize your code's dependence on the platform and devices used for calculations. The low-level math functions are isolated in a separate math engine module that has different implementations for different platforms, and the high-level code only has to select an appropriate math engine implementation to work with.
