    "Store training progress using the `dnn.store_checkpoint` method. Resume training from checkpoint by calling `dnn.load_checkpoint`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** NeoML checkpoints contain all the information required for training, *including the net architecture*. That allows us to `load_checkpoint` into any `neoml.Dnn.Dnn` object without the need to re-create architecture or solver before loading. However, this leads to the creation of new layer, solver, and blob objects during each `dnn.load_checkpoint`. If you had any previously created python variables which were pointing to the objects of the net *before loading* (like `solver`, `data` variables here), you must re-initialize them with the new ones."
